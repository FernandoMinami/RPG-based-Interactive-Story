# New Story Features Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully implemented two major new features for your story-based RPG:

1. **Random Encounter Nodes** - Dynamic c7. **Random Encounters**: Chance meetings with merchants, scholars, pickpockets
8. **Equipment Requirements**: Certain areas require specific equipped items
9. **Flexible Ability Matching**: Requirements can match by specific ID, elemental type, range, or damage typetent that appears with specified chances
2. **Advanced Conditional Choices** - Choices that appear/disappear or get rejected based on character attributes, physical characteristics, race, quests, items, and abilities

## üé≤ Random Encounter Nodes

### What it does:
- Adds random events that can trigger when entering any story node
- Each encounter has a configurable chance percentage (0-100%)
- Encounters can have their own requirements based on character attributes, quests, etc.
- When triggered, the encounter temporarily replaces the main node content

### How to use:
```json
{
  "title": "Main Location",
  "text": "You enter the town square...",
  "randomEncounters": [
    {
      "chance": 15,
      "title": "Traveling Merchant",
      "text": "A merchant approaches you!",
      "items": { "gold": 10 },
      "requirements": {
        "attributes": { "charisma": 12 }
      },
      "choices": [
        { "text": "Thank the merchant", "next": "continue" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## üéØ Conditional Choices System

### What it does:
- Choices can now be hidden or shown based on character attributes (intelligence, charisma, etc.)
- Physical characteristics (height, weight) affect available choices
- Race and type restrictions (some NPCs may reject certain races)
- Quest progress gates (choices only available if you've completed/started certain quests)
- Item and ability requirements (need specific items or magic abilities)
- Equipment requirements (must have certain items equipped)

### Types of Requirements:

#### 1. Attribute Requirements
```json
{
  "text": "Solve the puzzle (Intelligence 15+)",
  "requirements": {
    "attributes": { "intelligence": 15 }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Physical Requirements
```json
{
  "text": "Buy a horse",
  "requirements": {
    "physical": {
      "weight": { "max": 120 }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. Race/Type Requirements
```json
{
  "text": "Talk to the mayor (Humans welcome)",
  "requirements": {
    "raceType": {
      "acceptedRaces": ["human", "elf"],
      "rejectedRaces": ["orc"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### 4. Quest Requirements
```json
{
  "text": "Report your findings",
  "requirements": {
    "quests": {
      "activeQuests": ["investigation"],
      "completedQuests": ["previous-quest"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### 5. Item/Ability Requirements
```json
{
  "text": "Use fire magic to clear vines",
  "requirements": {
    "inventory": {
      "items": ["magic-focus"],
      "equippedItems": { "weapon": "flame-sword" }
    },
    "abilities": {
      "elementalType": "fire"
    }
  }
}
```

**New Ability Requirements Support:**
- `id`: Specific ability IDs (e.g., `["heal", "flameBurst"]`)

- `range`: Any ability with matching range (e.g., `["range", "close"]`)

## üèÜ Quest System

### New Features:
- `questStart`: Starts a new quest when choice is selected
- `questComplete`: Completes an active quest
- Automatic quest tracking in character save data
- Quest requirements for choices

### Character Properties Added:

## üö´ Rejection Messages

When choices would be rejected due to physical or social requirements:
- **Weight/Height**: "You are too heavy (150kg, maximum 120kg allowed)"
- **Race**: "Your race (orc) is not welcome here"
- **Type**: "Your type (evil) is not allowed here"

## üéÆ Testing

You can test the new features by:
1. Starting a new game
2. Choosing "Demo Town" or "Advanced Town" from the spawn point selection
3. Experimenting with different character builds:
   - High intelligence characters will see special observation choices
   - Different races get different dialogue options
   - Characters with fire magic can clear obstacles
   - Physical characteristics affect merchant interactions

## üîß Integration with Existing Systems

The new features integrate seamlessly with:
- ‚úÖ Existing dice roll system
- ‚úÖ Save/load functionality
- ‚úÖ Character creation and customization
- ‚úÖ Item and ability systems
- ‚úÖ Battle system (unchanged)
- ‚úÖ Environmental effects (unchanged)

## üìã Example Use Cases Implemented

1. **Intelligence Gates**: High-intelligence characters can spot hidden passages
2. **Race-Based Paths**: Different races get different reception from NPCs
3. **Physical Restrictions**: Horse merchants reject customers who are too heavy
