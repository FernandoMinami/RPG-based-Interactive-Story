## 📁 What Gets Created

When users create a story called "My Adventure":

```
story-content/
└── my-adventure/
    ├── README.md                    # Story documentation
    ├── scenarios/
    │   └── my-adventure-start.json  # Starting scenario
    ├── characters/                  # Character templates
    ├── enemies/                     # Enemy templates (if combat enabled)
    ├── abilities/                   # Ability templates (if combat enabled)
    └── items/                       # Item templates (if inventory enabled)
```

When they build a game:
```
../interactive-story-releases/
└── My-Adventure-Game-v1.0.0/
    └── My Adventure Game.exe        # Ready to share!
```
